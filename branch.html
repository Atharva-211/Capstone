  <h3 style="text-align:center;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p>Sustainable products and new technology are revolutionizing the way we live, work, and play. 
     With advancements in renewable energy, energy efficient products, and sustainable materials, 
	 it's never been easier to reduce our environmental impact

  </p>
  <p>From smart home devices to electric vehicles, there are more sustainable options than ever before. 
     This presentation will explore the exciting possibilities of sustainable products and new technology, 
	 and how they can be used to create a more sustainable future.</p>

            <p>Smarthome technology is one of the most popular sustainable products on the market today. Smart 
			   thermostats, lighting, and appliances can all be used to reduce energy consumption and save money.
            </p>
            <p>These products can be programmed to automatically turn off when not in use and can be monitored remotely. 
			   They provide convenience, comfort, and peace of mind, while also reducing our environmental impact.

            <p>Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, as they are much more efficient than traditional gasoline- powered cars. 
			   These vehicles are powered by rechargeable batteries and produce zero emissions.
               Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable and offer a range of features and benefits. They are also much quieter than 
			   gasoline-powered cars, making them a great option for reducing noise pollution.
            </p>
			<P>It’s not only individual vehicle owners who have better access to electric vehicles (EVs) than ever before—there 
             are 160 electric and hybrid vehicle models available today—but municipalities are taking notice as well.
			 In China, 300,000 electric buses hum down city streets every day. Their widespread adoption in China—an economic coup as much 
             as a policy one—will entice European cities to follow suit.
			 Although these eBuses have higher acquisition prices due to upfront battery costs, their total cost of ownership (TCO)
             is lower due to their independence from pricey diesel.
			 They also eliminate local particulates, including SOx, NOx, and CO2, all major issues in most cities today.

          <p>260 million tons of plastic waste is generated across the globe every year, but only 16 percent gets recycled.
          The plastics industry has the opportunity to move away from a “take, make, and dispose” business model and adopt a circular model, which 
	        aims to eliminate waste across sectors while creating economic, societal, and environmental benefits.
          One promising circular process is pyrolysis, which uses heat and the absence of oxygen to reconvert plastic waste back into liquid feedstock.
	     The benefits are economic as much as environmental, with a recycling-based profit pool estimated at $55 billion by the next decade.

         <p>Renewable energy continues to become cheaper and more accessible into 2019, a trend that has major implications for the nearly 
	        1 billion people across the globe without access to electricity.
            While expanding the grid is part of the access solution, countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, which account for a 
            majority of the world’s unelectrified population, are exploring renewable solutions like solar energy to bring energy quickly and inexpensively to millions.
            Innovative financing plans can help make previously unaffordable solar home systems (SHSs) a smart solution for communities that are too far from a 
			reliable grid connection. A recent McKinsey assessment determined that SHSs can help power 150 million households by 2020.

                 <p>The use of sustainable products can have a significant impact on the amount of waste being produced. Sustainable products are designed to be reused, 
				    reducing the need for new products and the waste associated with them. Sustainable products can also help to reduce the amount of waste going to 
					landfills, as they are made from biodegradable materials that can be broken down and recycled more easily.
				    Solid waste management is a comprehensive discipline, including controlling the waste generation, 
                    storage, transfer, and disposal in the best way for public health.
                    While the benefits of solid waste management have been realized all over the world, now it’s time for eco-friendly methods to swell.
                    Using these techniques, we can save our precious environment in many ways! Let’s start with the three 
                    R’s rule one by one.

            <p>Reducing waste is essential to preserving the environment, and there are several steps that can be taken to do so. These include reducing the 
			   use of single-use plastics, composting organic waste, and recycling whenever possible. Additionally, buying sustainable products can help reduce 
			   waste, as they are designed to last longer and produce less waste.
            </p>
			<P>Reducing waste has numerous benefits, including reducing air and water pollution, conserving natural resources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
			   It also helps preserve landfills, and can improve human health by reducing the spread of disease. Additionally, reducing waste can have economic benefits, 
			   as it can help save money on waste disposal costs.<BR>
               Definition of waste reduction is pretty simple, lessening or eliminating the number of materials initially used.
               Reusable serving utensils and trays instead of disposable items are perfect examples of waste reduction.
               Alternatively, reducing the amount you buy is the most essential of all the options to manage waste wisely.
               Why is waste reduction important? In fact, if each household mitigates its waste, the global garbage problem will be 
               reduced as well.
